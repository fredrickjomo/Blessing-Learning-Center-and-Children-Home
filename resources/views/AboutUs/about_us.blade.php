                <h3>More About Us</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Currently we have a six roomed muddy house in the Kwa Rhoda slum area and we have
                            been able to accomodate 103 vulnerable children.</p></li>
                    <li><p>We have employed 6 (six) teachers, one cook, one cleaner, a gate keeper and one social worker.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In future we would wish to have a house mother who would be able to stay with the children.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Medical check-ups are to be done once every month to ensure that the children are well looked
                            after and the necessary immunizations are taken to ensure they are healthy.</p></li>
                    <li><p>We need to secure funding to provide basic needs e.g equipment facilities, education and ongoing
                            suppport for the child as long as they need it.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>We would be glad to hear from well wishers who would like to <a href="">donate</a> on regular basis by standing
                                order as this will help us plan for the future</p></li>
